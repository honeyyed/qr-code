## My process
  Exactly what it says in the README file. Look at the design, build the HTML, then add CSS!

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS

### Continued development
In the future, I want to continue to get comfortable using hsl and hex colors. I'd also like to get more comfortable with not knowing everything and even forgetting things i've already learned!

### Useful resources
- [SuperSimpleDev's video "HTML & CSS-Beginner to Pro](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=qRzORzWXniRezqWh) - This helped me to learn HTML and CSS!
